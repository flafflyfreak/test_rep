This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.
```{r}
require("RCurl")
df <- read.csv(text = getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BES2016Workshop/reproduciblecodeR/master/iris.csv"))

# structure of the data
str(df)
```
The tidyr package provides functions to fix many of the issues in messy datasets.

gather() takes multiple columns and gathers them into key-value pairs. We can use this to get the species names into rows.

separate() takes one column and separates into multiple columns. We can use this to split the sample number from the measurement type.

spread() takes two columns (a key-value pair) and spreads them into multiple columns. We can use this to get the measurement types to form columns.

```{r}
require("tidyr")
df_ordered <- gather(df, key = "species", value= "measure.cm", -measurement)
df_ordered2 <- separate(df_ordered, col = "measurement", into= c("sample.number","measurement"),sep= "_")
df_ordered3 <- spread(df_ordered2, key=measurement, value=measure.cm)
```

```{r}
require("dplyr")
summarise_each(tbl(df_ordered3[,3:6]), group_by(df_ordered3,species), mean(),sd())
```

In a new code chunk in your R Notebook load the broom package with library(broom) and using the lm() and tidy() functions, fit a linear model relating petal length to petal width and 
output the table of coefficients.

```{r}
```

In a new code chunk in your R Notebook, load ggplot2 using library(ggplot2) and make a plot of the linear model created in the previous step. Colour the points by species name.
HINT Loading the cowplot package will change the look of the plots to be more suitable for publication.

```{r}
```

Python pandas comparison with R: Python can be quicker than R, and so is particularly useful when you have a large dataset. This website provides a more detailed look at the R language and its many third party libraries as they relate to the python pandas library
